        review:"Everyone is ready to give a recommendation but no one knew what to include. I worked in Delloite for 3years but I couldn't write one page about my experience and accomplishments even though I had so many. Then on my friend's suggestion, I contacted SOPify and boom, a small questionnaire and 2 days later, I had lors which I felt perfectly captured my tenure"

        review:"When the university asked me for the lor, I immediately knew that my professor will write a review. But I got confused when the professor ask me what to write. I was fortunate that I found about SOPify, with minimal inputs they gave me an amazing writeup for the letter of recommendation. I don't know how much it helped but probably thanks to that, I got admission to ASU."

        review:"To be honest, framing a SOP was daunting for me. I did not know where to begin, what facts to keep in mind, what questions to ask anyone i consulted. Something seemed to be incomplete. Thank you for being such an amazing and insightful consultant. You did absolutely everything with no time and effort from my side. And in the future, I would only recommend you to anyone i know who needs help. Thank you for framing me a very strong, effective, and structured SOP."

        review:"Hello... I cannot thank you enough for providing me with 2 great SOPs.Because of no free time and the fact that SOP needs a lot of dedication and sincere efforts, I had to rely on some external help and i am glad that i found the right one. Pocket-friendly rates and well structured. Thank you again for making my journey towards Masters."
