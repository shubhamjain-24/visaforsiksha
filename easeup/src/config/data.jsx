      "A good amount of Indian students aspire to or have desired at some point in their life to study abroad. Be it to have more exposure in their respective fields, to get a chance to explore new teaching methods or to get a better overall lifestyle. Studying abroad exposes you to a global community of students who are different in cultures and hence perspectives too. Studying abroad is an experience of a lifetime as it rounds your personality to a different level. You find like-minded people with the same interests but are entirely different from their point of view.",

      "Ill drafted application is one major cause. If the embassy is not convinced that you will return to your country after the completion of the course, they may reject your application for a visa. The increasing migration rates have led to embassies filtering applications and highly detesting those who plan on settling in their country in advance. Convince them that you have a family here to cater to and cannot and will not extend your stay in their country.",
      "Before planning to study abroad, the embassy makes it mandatory for you to block a certain amount of funds. They do so to ensure that you do not starve or get stranded in their country. You can withdraw a particular amount after reaching in the form of pocket money. To evaluate the financial capacity, the embassy is going to go over income tax files and financial statements to see if you or your family can afford it.",
      "Your application can also be rejected if you are terminally ill with a chronic disease and still plan to study abroad without any help.",
      "Another reason is, important documents are missing in your application file. Make sure you have attached all the necessary documents. In addition to this, ensure that the documents are in the right order, numbered, and easily accessible.",
      "Adding on, your visa application will get rejected if you provide the wrong information. Please make sure that you provide the correct information in your applications. The visa applications are verified thoroughly so ensure to mention only information that is hundred percent correct.",
      "You should also not have any existing court case against you or violent history. Legal records are cross-checked to ensure and establish your character.",

The last step occurs post the selection of the candidate into the University.",
    description_head1_P1:
      "While addressing the University for the programme applied to, the candidate has to justify why he/she has chosen the particular programme. They have to aptly reflect on how they got interested in the domain. Insights into the academic life of the student have to be provided to make sense of their journey. It should state the grades and their academic achievements. This would show the commitment the student possesses from early on since it is likely to be carried forward.",

      "The candidateâ€™s co-curricular achievements convey that they have a well-rounded personality. Academic institutions which are global epicentres for education prefer that the student has a record in co-curricular participation as well. Records in co-curricular activities strengthen the profile of the applicant as it inculcates essential life skills in them. Points have to be highlighted and prioritised to show that the applicant is going to prove to be an asset to the institution,",

      "When the same application goes to the embassy for the approval of the visa, the embassy evaluates the Statement of Purpose on the basis of a few parameters. Due to the rising migration rates, the embassy ensures that the candidate should not stay in their country post the completion of the course. The SOP has to aptly reflect that the candidateâ€™s roots are in their home country and they intend to go back to their country post the completion of the programme. The SOP has to do justice to stating the bonding with their family and friends.",
